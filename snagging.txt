Done
----

* Make logo clickable to homepage
* Ensure the channel video scrolling aligns per page
* Grey out scroll button when inactive
* Swap scroll button direction
* Fix footer link to lagtv1 YT url
* I think we'll name the tabs for the main bar to be "LAGTV" and "LAGTV2" instead of StarCraft and Lets Play, respectively
* When people click on one of the videos in the top bar it should open in a new tab as to keep them on the website for later
* The links at the bottom of the home page should be in more than one column. I'd suggest all the Youtube channels and Machinima in one, the streams in another, and the store/about in the last. 
* Layout addition to put the page content inside a container expect for the homepage instead for adding this to everypage
* Change the YT button on the banner to a store button
* Improve formatting of the forum on the homepage
* Format other areas:
  - Login page
  - Forgotten password page
  - Register page
  - Upload replay page
