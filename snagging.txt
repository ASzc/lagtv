To Discuss
----------

* If it's possible, can we make the content bar section larger? I feel like it's a bit on the small side. For scale, perhaps enlarging the video section to the bottom of where the content bar below it is? I know it's a scale thing, and if it can't be done that's fine. I just thought it might look a bit better overall.

Done
----

* Make logo clickable to homepage
* Ensure the channel video scrolling aligns per page
* Grey out scroll button when inactive
* Swap scroll button direction
* Fix footer link to lagtv1 YT url
* I think we'll name the tabs for the main bar to be "LAGTV" and "LAGTV2" instead of StarCraft and Lets Play, respectively
* When people click on one of the videos in the top bar it should open in a new tab as to keep them on the website for later
* The links at the bottom of the home page should be in more than one column. I'd suggest all the Youtube channels and Machinima in one, the streams in another, and the store/about in the last. 
* Layout addition to put the page content inside a container expect for the homepage instead for adding this to everypage
* Change the YT button on the banner to a store button
* Improve formatting of the forum on the homepage
* Format other areas:
  - Login page
  - Forgotten password page
  - Register page
  - Upload replay page
  - Admin replay pages
  - About page
  - Profile page
  - Admin user pages
  - All forum pages
* Fix homepage in IE8/9
* Fixed security issue by disabling autocomplete for passwords
* On the forums under the LAGTV section it should be LAGTV1 and LAGTV2, not SC2 and Minecraft.
* "Latest activity from the forums" should probably be "Latest Forum Activity" *note the capitalization as well.
* The category item "Ffa" should be all caps FFA
* Categories for replays should be Normal Game, When Cheese Fails, Inbox to Icebox. I'm assuming it's easy to add/remove these when needed down the road?
* Add Chris Marks to the contributor page under testing.
* Haven't decided yet, but I feel like the forum topic headers may look better if they were that red instead of the blue but I'll leave it to you to see what you think. 
* Tidy up the forum admin screens
