Snagging
========

To Do
-----

* Improve formatting of the forum on the homepage
* Change the YT button on the banner to a store button

To Discuss
----------

* I think the home page should still have the bar for sending in the replays that was on the original design doc I was sent. In time if it becomes less of a prominent feature we can do what you have now but I think until then it'll be one of the main reasons why people will be going to the site. 


Done
----

* Make logo clickable to homepage
* Ensure the channel video scrolling aligns per page
* Grey out scroll button when inactive
* Swap scroll button direction
* Fix footer link to lagtv1 YT url
* I think we'll name the tabs for the main bar to be "LAGTV" and "LAGTV2" instead of StarCraft and Lets Play, respectively
* When people click on one of the videos in the top bar it should open in a new tab as to keep them on the website for later
* The links at the bottom of the home page should be in more than one column. I'd suggest all the Youtube channels and Machinima in one, the streams in another, and the store/about in the last. 
* Layout addition to put the page content inside a container expect for the homepage instead for adding this to everypage
