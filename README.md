LagTV Website
=============

Calling all fans of [LagTV](http://www.youtube.com/user/LifesAGlitchTV). We, the bouses and bousettes of LagTV are building an awesome website for the community. Let's keep it open source and freely available so the guys always have access to it.

Status
======

We have spoken to Adam and he has given us the green light to go ahead and build the LagTV website. This is going to be a site by the community, for the community.

We have completed the initial requirements and wireframes, [so check them out here](http://github.com/andypike/lagtv/wiki/Requirements).

We have setup a development server that will reflect the changes to the master branch, this will allow you to see the [current state of the website](http://220.233.86.240:8000)

We have found a few good designers who are currently putting something together for the homepage (it needs it).

Discussions
===========

We've created a Google Group which will enable to the team to discuss requirements, coding standards and all other aspects of the project. Keeping everything in the open :o) Checkout the [LagTV Website Discussion Group](http://groups.google.com/group/lagtv-website?hl=en)
