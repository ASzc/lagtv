LagTV Website
=============

Calling all fans of lagtv http://www.youtube.com/user/LifesAGlitchTV. I propose that we, the bouses and bousettes of lagtv, build a website for them. Let's keep it open source and freely available so the guys always have access to it.

What we need
============

* Approval from Adam and Jeff
* A list of features from Jeff and Adam so we can start
* Ruby on Rails developers
* A designer or two
* Anyone else to help test the site

The Team
========

Below are the team that we've assembled so far, if you're interested then please let me know. 

Core Development
----------------

All of us in the core team work for the same web agency in the UK. We do this for a living, we are lagtv fans and we play a bit of StarCraft too.

* Andy Pike
* George Good
* Ville Hellman

Other Contributers

Here is a list of other members of the community that have shown an interest in contributing:

How to contribute
=================

* Developers: Fork this repro then create a feature branch for your changes. Please do not add changes to the master branch. When you are done, please send a pull request and the core team will review the changes and then merge into master.
* Designers: We'll work this out.
* Testers: Once the staging site is up and running, start testing and create issues here in the github issue tracker.



That's it for now, let's do this for the guys. They need our help! Contact me on twitter @andypike if you are interested and I'll let you know when we are ready.

Jeff and Adam, if you would like to discuss this further please ping me on twitter and we'll see what we can do.
