LagTV Website
=============

Calling all fans of lagtv http://www.youtube.com/user/LifesAGlitchTV. I propose that we, the bouses and bousettes of lagtv, build a website for them. Let's keep it open source and freely available so the guys always have access to it.

What we need
============

* Approval from Adam and Jeff
* A list of features from Jeff and Adam so we can start
* Ruby on Rails developers
* A designer or two
* Anyone else to help test the site

The Team
========

Below are the team that we've assembled so far, if you're interested then please let me know.

Core Development
----------------

* Andy Pike
* George Good
* Ville Hellman

Other Contributers
------------------

* None confirmed

Designers

How to contribute
=================

* Fork this repro then create a feature branch for your changes. Please do not add changes to the master branch. When you are done, please send a pull request and the core team will review the changes and then merge into master.



That's it for now, let's do this for the guys. They need our help! Contact me on twitter @andypike if you are interested and I'll let you know when we are ready.

Bouse!
