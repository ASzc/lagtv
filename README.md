LagTV Website
=============

Calling all fans of [LagTV](http://www.youtube.com/user/LifesAGlitchTV). I propose that we, the bouses and bousettes of lagtv, build a website for them. Let's keep it open source and freely available so the guys always have access to it.

What we need
============

* Approval from Adam and Jeff
* A list of requirements from Jeff and Adam so we can start. [We've started our own to get the ball rolling](http://github.com/andypike/lagtv/wiki/Requirements)
* Ruby on Rails developers
* A designer or two
* Anyone else to help test the site

Discussions
===========

I've created a Google Group which will enable to the team to discuss requirements, coding standards and all other aspects of the project. Keeping everything in the open :o) Checkout the [LagTV Website Discussion Group](http://groups.google.com/group/lagtv-website?hl=en)

The Team
========

Below are the team that we've assembled so far, if you're interested then please let me know. 

Core Development
----------------

All of us in the core team work for the same web agency in the UK. We do this for a living, we are lagtv fans and we play a bit of StarCraft too.
