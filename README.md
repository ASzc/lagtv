LagTV Website
=============

Calling all fans of lagtv http://www.youtube.com/user/LifesAGlitchTV. I propose that we, the bouses and bousettes of lagtv, build a website for them. Let's keep it open source and freely available so the guys always have access to it.

What we need
============

* A list of features from Jeff and Adam so we can start
* Ruby on Rails developers
* A designer or two
* Anyone else to help test the site

Then what
=========

I'm happy to set up the project and help manage it here in my free time. I'll be able to contribute some code too. Once we have this off the ground, I'll need you guys to start sending your pull requests (more details to follow).

This GitHub repro will be the official home but you are free to fork as required.

We can use the GitHub issue tracker for bug reports and tasks.

Hosting
=======

We can start off on a free heroku environment for staging and then we'll discuss the live environment. I'd recommend heroku but it'll be up to Adam and Jeff as this will need to be paid for.


That's it for now, let's do this for the guys. They need our help! Contact me on twitter @andypike if you are interested and I'll let you know when we are ready.

Bouse!
