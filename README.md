LagTV Website
=============

Calling all fans of [LagTV](http://www.youtube.com/user/LifesAGlitchTV). We, the bouses and bousettes of LagTV are building an awesome website for the community. Let's keep it open source and freely available so the guys always have access to it.

Status 
======

The first version of the site is now done and we are in final testing. Hoping to get the site live in the next week or so.

Sneak Peak
==========

We have a testing server setup where you can see the site and play around with it. We'll be using this as a staging site to try out new features before they go live. [You can try it out here](http://lagtv.andypike.com).

Discussions
===========

We've created a Google Group which will enable to the team to discuss requirements, coding standards and all other aspects of the project. Keeping everything in the open :o) Checkout the [LagTV Website Discussion Group](http://groups.google.com/group/lagtv-website?hl=en)

The Team

We've had a lot of help building the site. [We've added an about page](http://lagtv.andypike.com/about) to list those that have asked to be mentioned.
